# ðŸ”Š voicechat-interaction-paper

A Paper port of henkelmax's [voicechat-interaction](https://github.com/henkelmax/voicechat-interaction), allowing for Sculk detection of Simple Voice Chat audio on Bukkit-based servers

Currently, it is using the `STEP` GameEvent (Sculk Sensor frequency `1`). Custom frequency support will come once I figure out how to add a custom GameEvent to the registry on Spigot. All other config options are implemented, see [here](https://github.com/henkelmax/voicechat-interaction/#config-values) for details.
