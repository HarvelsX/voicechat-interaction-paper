# ðŸ”Š voicechat-interaction-paper

A Paper port of henkelmax's [voicechat-interaction](https://github.com/henkelmax/voicechat-interaction), allowing for Sculk detection of Simple Voice Chat audio on Paper-based servers

Currently, it is using the `PRIME_FUSE` GameEvent (Sculk Sensor frequency `7`). This is for parity with the default frequency of the official mod, as it is not possible (to my knowledge) to inject custom GameEvents into the Sculk Sensor's frequency map. All other config options are implemented, see [here](https://github.com/henkelmax/voicechat-interaction/#config-values) for details.
